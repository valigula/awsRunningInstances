# awsRunningInstances

Use Python to comunicate with aws and report in realtime, the number and type of instance. Very usefull when using autoscaling groups.
Script like that is very handy when devops does not have access to the Billing Report.
Stored the data in a influxdb database, later you can use a tool like grafana to Display the data.
